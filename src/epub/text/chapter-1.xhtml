				<p>Those English psychologists, who up to the present are the only philosophers who are to be thanked for any endeavour to get as far as a history of the origin of morality⁠—these men, I say, offer us in their own personalities no paltry problem;⁠—they even have, if I am to be quite frank about it, in their capacity of living riddles, an advantage over their books⁠—<em>they themselves are interesting!</em> These English psychologists⁠—what do they really mean? We always find them voluntarily or involuntarily at the same task of pushing to the front the <i xml:lang="fr">partie honteuse</i> of our inner world, and looking for the efficient, governing, and decisive principle in that precise quarter where the intellectual self-respect of the race would be the most reluctant to find it (for example, in the <i xml:lang="la">vis inertiae</i> of habit, or in forgetfulness, or in a blind and fortuitous mechanism and association of ideas, or in some factor that is purely passive, reflex, molecular, or fundamentally stupid)⁠—what is the real motive power which always impels these psychologists in precisely <em>this</em> direction? Is it an instinct for human disparagement somewhat sinister, vulgar, and malignant, or perhaps incomprehensible even to itself? or perhaps a touch of pessimistic jealousy, the mistrust of disillusioned idealists who have become gloomy, poisoned, and bitter? or a petty subconscious enmity and rancour against Christianity (and Plato), that has conceivably never crossed the threshold of consciousness? or just a vicious taste for those elements of life which are bizarre, painfully paradoxical, mystical, and illogical? or, as a final alternative, a dash of each of these motives⁠—a little vulgarity, a little gloominess, a little anti-Christianity, a little craving for the necessary piquancy?</p>
				<p>But I am told that it is simply a case of old frigid and tedious frogs crawling and hopping around men and inside men, as if they were as thoroughly at home there, as they would be in a <em>swamp</em>.</p>
				<p>I am opposed to this statement, nay, I do not believe it; and if, in the impossibility of knowledge, one is permitted to wish, so do I wish from my heart that just the converse metaphor should apply, and that these analysts with their psychological microscopes should be, at bottom, brave, proud, and magnanimous animals who know how to bridle both their hearts and their smarts, and have specifically trained themselves to sacrifice what is desirable to what is true, <em>any</em> truth in fact, even the simple, bitter, ugly, repulsive, unchristian, and immoral truths⁠—for there are truths of that description.</p>

				<p>All honour, then, to the noble spirits who would fain dominate these historians of morality. But it is certainly a pity that they lack the <em>historical sense</em> itself, that they themselves are quite deserted by all the beneficent spirits of history. The whole train of their thought runs, as was always the way of old-fashioned philosophers, on <em>thoroughly</em> unhistorical lines: there is no doubt on this point. The crass ineptitude of their genealogy of morals is immediately apparent when the question arises of ascertaining the origin of the idea and judgment of “good.” “Man had originally,” so speaks their decree, “praised and called ‘good’ altruistic acts from the standpoint of those on whom they were conferred, that is, those to whom they were <em>useful</em>; subsequently the origin of this praise was <em>forgotten</em>, and altruistic acts, simply because, as a sheer matter of habit, they were praised as good, came also to be felt as good⁠—as though they contained in themselves some intrinsic goodness.” The thing is obvious:⁠—this initial derivation contains already all the typical and idiosyncratic traits of the English psychologists⁠—we have “utility,” “forgetting,” “habit,” and finally “error,” the whole assemblage forming the basis of a system of values, on which the higher man has up to the present prided himself as though it were a kind of privilege of man in general. This pride <em>must</em> be brought low, this system of values <em>must</em> lose its values: is that attained?</p>
				<p>Now the first argument that comes ready to my hand is that the real homestead of the concept “good” is sought and located in the wrong place: the judgment “good” did <em>not</em> originate among those to whom goodness was shown. Much rather has it been the good themselves, that is, the aristocratic, the powerful, the high-stationed, the high-minded, who have felt that they themselves were good, and that their actions were good, that is to say of the first order, in contradistinction to all the low, the low-minded, the vulgar, and the plebeian. It was out of this pathos of distance that they first arrogated the right to create values for their own profit, and to coin the names of such values: what had they to do with utility? The standpoint of utility is as alien and as inapplicable as it could possibly be, when we have to deal with so volcanic an effervescence of supreme values, creating and demarcating as they do a hierarchy within themselves: it is at this juncture that one arrives at an appreciation of the contrast to that tepid temperature, which is the presupposition on which every combination of worldly wisdom and every calculation of practical expediency is always based⁠—and not for one occasional, not for one exceptional instance, but chronically. The pathos of nobility and distance, as I have said, the chronic and despotic <i xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and fundamental instinct of a higher dominant race coming into association with a meaner race, an “under race,” this is the origin of the antithesis of good and bad.</p>
				<p>(The masters’ right of giving names goes so far that it is permissible to look upon language itself as the expression of the power of the masters: they say “this <em>is</em> that, and that,” they seal finally every object and every event with a sound, and thereby at the same time take possession of it.) It is because of this origin that the word “good” is far from having any necessary connection with altruistic acts, in accordance with the superstitious belief of these moral philosophers. On the contrary, it is on the occasion of the <em>decay</em> of aristocratic values, that the antitheses between “egoistic” and “altruistic” presses more and more heavily on the human conscience⁠—it is, to use my own language, the <em>herd instinct</em> which finds in this antithesis an expression in many ways. And even then it takes a considerable time for this instinct to become sufficiently dominant, for the valuation to be inextricably dependent on this antithesis (as is the case in contemporary Europe); for today that prejudice is predominant, which, acting even now with all the intensity of an obsession and brain disease, holds that “moral,” “altruistic,” and “<i xml:lang="fr">désintéressé</i>” are concepts of equal value.</p>

				<p>In the second place, quite apart from the fact that this hypothesis as to the genesis of the value “good” cannot be historically upheld, it suffers from an inherent psychological contradiction. The utility of altruistic conduct has presumably been the origin of its being praised, and this origin has become <em>forgotten</em>:⁠—But in what conceivable way is this forgetting <em>possible</em>! Has perchance the utility of such conduct ceased at some given moment? The contrary is the case. This utility has rather been experienced every day at all times, and is consequently a feature that obtains a new and regular emphasis with every fresh day; it follows that, so far from vanishing from the consciousness, so far indeed from being forgotten, it must necessarily become impressed on the consciousness with ever-increasing distinctness. How much more logical is that contrary theory (it is not the truer for that) which is represented, for instance, by Herbert Spencer, who places the concept “good” as essentially similar to the concept “useful,” “purposive,” so that in the judgments “good” and “bad” mankind is simply summarising and investing with a sanction its <em>unforgotten</em> and <em>unforgettable</em> experiences concerning the “useful-purposive” and the “mischievous-non-purposive.” According to this theory, “good” is the attribute of that which has previously shown itself useful; and so is able to claim to be considered “valuable in the highest degree,” “valuable in itself.” This method of explanation is also, as I have said, wrong, but at any rate the explanation itself is coherent, and psychologically tenable.</p>

				<p>The guidepost which first put me on the <em>right</em> track was this question⁠—what is the true etymological significance of the various symbols for the idea “good” which have been coined in the various languages? I then found that they all led back to <em>the same evolution of the same idea</em>⁠—that everywhere “aristocrat,” “noble” (in the social sense), is the root idea, out of which have necessarily developed “good” in the sense of “with aristocratic soul,” “noble,” in the sense of “with a soul of high calibre,” “with a privileged soul”⁠—a development which invariably runs parallel with that other evolution by which “vulgar,” “plebeian,” “low,” are made to change finally into “bad.” The most eloquent proof of this last contention is the German word “<i xml:lang="de">schlecht</i>” itself: this word is identical with “<i xml:lang="de">schlicht</i>”⁠—(compare “<i xml:lang="de">schlechtweg</i>” and “<i xml:lang="de">schlechterdings</i>”)⁠—which, originally and as yet without any sinister innuendo, simply denoted the plebeian man in contrast to the aristocratic man. It is at the sufficiently late period of the Thirty Years’ War that this sense becomes changed to the sense now current. From the standpoint of the Genealogy of Morals this discovery seems to be substantial: the lateness of it is to be attributed to the retarding influence exercised in the modern world by democratic prejudice in the sphere of all questions of origin. This extends, as will shortly be shown, even to the province of natural science and physiology, which, prima facie is the most objective. The extent of the mischief which is caused by this prejudice (once it is free of all trammels except those of its own malice), particularly to Ethics and History, is shown by the notorious case of Buckle: it was in Buckle that that <em>plebeianism</em> of the modern spirit, which is of English origin, broke out once again from its malignant soil with all the violence of a slimy volcano, and with that salted, rampant, and vulgar eloquence with which up to the present time all volcanoes have spoken.</p>

				<p>With regard to <em>our</em> problem, which can justly be called an <em>intimate</em> problem, and which elects to appeal to only a limited number of ears: it is of no small interest to ascertain that in those words and roots which denote “good” we catch glimpses of that arch-trait, on the strength of which the aristocrats feel themselves to be beings of a higher order than their fellows. Indeed, they call themselves in perhaps the most frequent instances simply after their superiority in power (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> “the powerful,” “the lords,” “the commanders”), or after the most obvious sign of their superiority, as for example “the rich,” “the possessors” (that is the meaning of <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">arya</i>; and the Iranian and Slav languages correspond). But they also call themselves after some <em>characteristic idiosyncrasy</em>; and this is the case which now concerns us. They name themselves, for instance, “the truthful”: this is first done by the Greek nobility whose mouthpiece is found in Theognis, the Megarian poet. The word <i xml:lang="grc">ἐσθλος</i>, which is coined for the purpose, signifies etymologically “one who <em>is</em>,” who has reality, who is real, who is true; and then with a subjective twist, the “true,” as the “truthful”: at this stage in the evolution of the idea, it becomes the motto and party cry of the nobility, and quite completes the transition to the meaning “noble,” so as to place outside the pale the lying, vulgar man, as Theognis conceives and portrays him⁠—till finally the word after the decay of the nobility is left to delineate psychological noblesse, and becomes as it were ripe and mellow. In the word <i xml:lang="grc">κακός</i> as in <i xml:lang="grc">δειλός</i> (the plebeian in contrast to the ἀγαθός) the cowardice is emphasised. This affords perhaps an inkling on what lines the etymological origin of the very ambiguous <i xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθός</i> is to be investigated. In the Latin <i xml:lang="la">malus</i> (which I place side by side with μέλας) the vulgar man can be distinguished as the dark-coloured, and above all as the black-haired (“<i xml:lang="la">hic niger est</i>”), as the pre-Aryan inhabitants of the Italian soil, whose complexion formed the clearest feature of distinction from the dominant blondes, namely, the Aryan conquering race:⁠—at any rate Gaelic has afforded me the exact analogue⁠—<i xml:lang="ga">Fin</i> (for instance, in the name <i xml:lang="ga">Fin-Gal</i>), the distinctive word of the nobility, finally⁠—good, noble, clean, but originally the blonde-haired man in contrast to the dark black-haired aboriginals. The Celts, if I may make a parenthetic statement, were throughout a blonde race; and it is wrong to connect, as Virchow still connects, those traces of an essentially dark-haired population which are to be seen on the more elaborate ethnographical maps of Germany with any Celtic ancestry or with any admixture of Celtic blood: in this context it is rather the <em>pre-Aryan</em> population of Germany which surges up to these districts. (The same is true substantially of the whole of Europe: in point of fact, the subject race has finally again obtained the upper hand, in complexion and the shortness of the skull, and perhaps in the intellectual and social qualities. Who can guarantee that modern democracy, still more modern anarchy, and indeed that tendency to the “Commune,” the most primitive form of society, which is now common to all the Socialists in Europe, does not in its real essence signify a monstrous reversion⁠—and that the conquering and <em>master</em> race⁠—the Aryan race, is not also becoming inferior physiologically?) I believe that I can explain the Latin <i xml:lang="la">bonus</i> as the “warrior”: my hypothesis is that I am right in deriving <i xml:lang="la">bonus</i> from an older <i xml:lang="la">duonus</i> (compare <i xml:lang="la">bellum</i> = <i xml:lang="la">duellum</i> = <i xml:lang="la">duen-lum</i>, in which the word <i xml:lang="la">duonus</i> appears to me to be contained). Bonus accordingly as the man of discord, of variance, “<i xml:lang="de">Entzweiung</i>” (<i xml:lang="la">duo</i>), as the warrior: one sees what in ancient Rome “the good” meant for a man. Must not our actual German word <i xml:lang="de">gut</i> mean “<em>the godlike</em>, the man of godlike race”? and be identical with the national name (originally the nobles’ name) of the <em>Goths</em>?</p>

				<p>Above all, there is no exception (though there are opportunities for exceptions) to this rule, that the idea of political superiority always resolves itself into the idea of psychological superiority, in those cases where the highest caste is at the same time the <em>priestly</em> caste, and in accordance with its general characteristics confers on itself the privilege of a title which alludes specifically to its priestly function. It is in these cases, for instance, that “clean” and “unclean” confront each other for the first time as badges of class distinction; here again there develops a “good” and a “bad,” in a sense which has ceased to be merely social. Moreover, care should be taken not to take these ideas of “clean” and “unclean” too seriously, too broadly, or too symbolically: all the ideas of ancient man have, on the contrary, got to be understood in their initial stages, in a sense which is, to an almost inconceivable extent, crude, coarse, physical, and narrow, and above all essentially <em>unsymbolical</em>. The “clean man” is originally only a man who washes himself, who abstains from certain foods which are conducive to skin diseases, who does not sleep with the unclean women of the lower classes, who has a horror of blood⁠—not more, not much more! On the other hand, the very nature of a priestly aristocracy shows the reasons why just at such an early juncture there should ensue a really dangerous sharpening and intensification of opposed values: it is, in fact, through these opposed values that gulfs are cleft in the social plane, which a veritable Achilles of free thought would shudder to cross. There is from the outset a certain <em>diseased taint</em> in such sacerdotal aristocracies, and in the habits which prevail in such societies⁠—habits which, <em>averse</em> as they are to action, constitute a compound of introspection and explosive emotionalism, as a result of which there appears that introspective morbidity and neurasthenia, which adheres almost inevitably to all priests at all times: with regard, however, to the remedy which they themselves have invented for this disease⁠—the philosopher has no option but to state, that it has proved itself in its effects a hundred times more dangerous than the disease, from which it should have been the deliverer. Humanity itself is still diseased from the effects of the naivetes of this priestly cure. Take, for instance, certain kinds of diet (abstention from flesh), fasts, sexual continence, flight into the wilderness (a kind of Weir-Mitchell isolation, though of course without that system of excessive feeding and fattening which is the most efficient antidote to all the hysteria of the ascetic ideal); consider too the whole metaphysic of the priests, with its war on the senses, its enervation, its hairsplitting; consider its self-hypnotism on the fakir and Brahman principles (it uses Brahman as a glass disc and obsession), and that climax which we can understand only too well of an unusual satiety with its panacea of <em>nothingness</em> (or God:⁠—the demand for a <i xml:lang="la">unio mystica</i> with God is the demand of the Buddhist for nothingness, Nirvana⁠—and nothing else!). In sacerdotal societies <em>every</em> element is on a more dangerous scale, not merely cures and remedies, but also pride, revenge, cunning, exaltation, love, ambition, virtue, morbidity:⁠—further, it can fairly be stated that it is on the soil of this <em>essentially dangerous</em> form of human society, the sacerdotal form, that man really becomes for the first time an <em>interesting animal</em>, that it is in this form that the soul of man has in a higher sense attained <em>depths</em> and become <em>evil</em>⁠—and those are the two fundamental forms of the superiority which up to the present man has exhibited over every other animal.</p>

				<p>The reader will have already surmised with what ease the priestly mode of valuation can branch off from the knightly aristocratic mode, and then develop into the very antithesis of the latter: special impetus is given to this opposition, by every occasion when the castes of the priests and warriors confront each other with mutual jealousy and cannot agree over the prize. The knightly-aristocratic “values” are based on a careful cult of the physical, on a flowering, rich, and even effervescing healthiness, that goes considerably beyond what is necessary for maintaining life, on war, adventure, the chase, the dance, the tourney⁠—on everything, in fact, which is contained in strong, free, and joyous action. The priestly-aristocratic mode of valuation is⁠—we have seen⁠—based on other hypotheses: it is bad enough for this class when it is a question of war! Yet the priests are, as is notorious, <em>the worst enemies</em>⁠—why? Because they are the weakest. Their weakness causes their hate to expand into a monstrous and sinister shape, a shape which is most crafty and most poisonous. The really great haters in the history of the world have always been priests, who are also the cleverest haters⁠—in comparison with the cleverness of priestly revenge, every other piece of cleverness is practically negligible. Human history would be too fatuous for anything were it not for the cleverness imported into it by the weak⁠—take at once the most important instance. All the world’s efforts against the “aristocrats,” the “mighty,” the “masters,” the “holders of power,” are negligible by comparison with what has been accomplished against those classes by <em>the Jews</em>⁠—the Jews, that priestly nation which eventually realised that the one method of effecting satisfaction on its enemies and tyrants was by means of a radical transvaluation of values, which was at the same time an act of the <em>cleverest revenge</em>. Yet the method was only appropriate to a nation of priests, to a nation of the most jealously nursed priestly revengefulness. It was the Jews who, in opposition to the aristocratic equation (good = aristocratic = beautiful = happy = loved by the gods), dared with a terrifying logic to suggest the contrary equation, and indeed to maintain with the teeth of the most profound hatred (the hatred of weakness) this contrary equation, namely, “the wretched are alone the good; the poor, the weak, the lowly, are alone the good; the suffering, the needy, the sick, the loathsome, are the only ones who are pious, the only ones who are blessed, for them alone is salvation⁠—but you, on the other hand, you aristocrats, you men of power, you are to all eternity the evil, the horrible, the covetous, the insatiate, the godless; eternally also shall you be the unblessed, the cursed, the damned!” We know who it was who reaped the heritage of this Jewish transvaluation. In the context of the monstrous and inordinately fateful initiative which the Jews have exhibited in connection with this most fundamental of all declarations of war, I remember the passage which came to my pen on another occasion (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Beyond Good and Evil</i>, <abbr>Aph.</abbr> 195)⁠—that it was, in fact, with the Jews that the <em>revolt of the slaves</em> begins in the sphere <em>of morals</em>; that revolt which has behind it a history of two millennia, and which at the present day has only moved out of our sight, because it⁠—has achieved victory.</p>

				<p>But you understand this not? You have no eyes for a force which has taken two thousand years to achieve victory?⁠—There is nothing wonderful in this: all <em>lengthy</em> processes are hard to see and to realise. But <em>this</em> is what took place: from the trunk of that tree of revenge and hate, Jewish hate⁠—that most profound and sublime hate, which creates ideals and changes old values to new creations, the like of which has never been on earth⁠—there grew a phenomenon which was equally incomparable, <em>a new love</em>, the most profound and sublime of all kinds of love;⁠—and from what other trunk could it have grown? But beware of supposing that this love has soared on its upward growth, as in any way a real negation of that thirst for revenge, as an antithesis to the Jewish hate! No, the contrary is the truth! This love grew out of that hate, as its crown, as its triumphant crown, circling wider and wider amid the clarity and fullness of the sun, and pursuing in the very kingdom of light and height its goal of hatred, its victory, its spoil, its strategy, with the same intensity with which the roots of that tree of hate sank into everything which was deep and evil with increasing stability and increasing desire. This Jesus of Nazareth, the incarnate gospel of love, this “Redeemer” bringing salvation and victory to the poor, the sick, the sinful⁠—was he not really temptation in its most sinister and irresistible form, temptation to take the tortuous path to those very <em>Jewish</em> values and those very Jewish ideals? Has not Israel really obtained the final goal of its sublime revenge, by the tortuous paths of this “Redeemer,” for all that he might pose as Israel’s adversary and Israel’s destroyer? Is it not due to the black magic of a really <em>great</em> policy of revenge, of a farseeing, burrowing revenge, both acting and calculating with slowness, that Israel himself must repudiate before all the world the actual instrument of his own revenge and nail it to the cross, so that all the world⁠—that is, all the enemies of Israel⁠—could nibble without suspicion at this very bait? Could, moreover, any human mind with all its elaborate ingenuity invent a bait that was more truly <em>dangerous</em>? Anything that was even equivalent in the power of its seductive, intoxicating, defiling, and corrupting influence to that symbol of the holy cross, to that awful paradox of a “god on the cross,” to that mystery of the unthinkable, supreme, and utter horror of the self-crucifixion of a god for the <em>salvation of man</em>? It is at least certain that <i xml:lang="la">sub hoc signo</i> Israel, with its revenge and transvaluation of all values, has up to the present always triumphed again over all other ideals, over all more aristocratic ideals.</p>

				<p>“But why do you talk of nobler ideals? Let us submit to the facts; that the people have triumphed⁠—or the slaves, or the populace, or the herd, or whatever name you care to give them⁠—if this has happened through the Jews, so be it! In that case no nation ever had a greater mission in the world’s history. The ‘masters’ have been done away with; the morality of the vulgar man has triumphed. This triumph may also be called a blood-poisoning (it has mutually fused the races)⁠—I do not dispute it; but there is no doubt but that this intoxication has succeeded. The ‘redemption’ of the human race (that is, from the masters) is progressing swimmingly; everything is obviously becoming Judaised, or Christianised, or vulgarised (what is there in the words?). It seems impossible to stop the course of this poisoning through the whole body politic of mankind⁠—but its tempo and pace may from the present time be slower, more delicate, quieter, more discreet⁠—there is time enough. In view of this context has the Church nowadays any necessary purpose? has it, in fact, a right to live? Or could man get on without it? <i xml:lang="la">Quaeritur.</i> It seems that it fetters and retards this tendency, instead of accelerating it. Well, even that might be its utility. The Church certainly is a crude and boorish institution, that is repugnant to an intelligence with any pretence at delicacy, to a really modern taste. Should it not at any rate learn to be somewhat more subtle? It alienates nowadays, more than it allures. Which of us would, forsooth, be a freethinker if there were no Church? It is the Church which repels us, not its poison⁠—apart from the Church we like the poison.” This is the epilogue of a freethinker to my discourse, of an honourable animal (as he has given abundant proof), and a democrat to boot; he had up to that time listened to me, and could not endure my silence, but for me, indeed, with regard to this topic there is much on which to be silent.</p>

				<p>The revolt of the slaves in morals begins in the very principle of <em>resentment</em> becoming creative and giving birth to values⁠—a resentment experienced by creatures who, deprived as they are of the proper outlet of action, are forced to find their compensation in an imaginary revenge. While every aristocratic morality springs from a triumphant affirmation of its own demands, the slave morality says “no” from the very outset to what is “outside itself,” “different from itself,” and “not itself”: and this “no” is its creative deed. This volte-face of the valuing standpoint⁠—this <em>inevitable</em> gravitation to the objective instead of back to the subjective⁠—is typical of “resentment”: the slave-morality requires as the condition of its existence an external and objective world, to employ physiological terminology, it requires objective stimuli to be capable of action at all⁠—its action is fundamentally a reaction. The contrary is the case when we come to the aristocrat’s system of values: it acts and grows spontaneously, it merely seeks its antithesis in order to pronounce a more grateful and exultant “yes” to its own self;⁠—its negative conception, “low,” “vulgar,” “bad,” is merely a pale late-born foil in comparison with its positive and fundamental conception (saturated as it is with life and passion), of “we aristocrats, we good ones, we beautiful ones, we happy ones.”</p>
				<p>When the aristocratic morality goes astray and commits sacrilege on reality, this is limited to that particular sphere with which it is <em>not</em> sufficiently acquainted⁠—a sphere, in fact, from the real knowledge of which it disdainfully defends itself. It misjudges, in some cases, the sphere which it despises, the sphere of the common vulgar man and the low people: on the other hand, due weight should be given to the consideration that in any case the mood of contempt, of disdain, of superciliousness, even on the supposition that it <em>falsely</em> portrays the object of its contempt, will always be far removed from that degree of falsity which will always characterise the attacks⁠—in effigy, of course⁠—of the vindictive hatred and revengefulness of the weak in onslaughts on their enemies. In point of fact, there is in contempt too strong an admixture of nonchalance, of casualness, of boredom, of impatience, even of personal exultation, for it to be capable of distorting its victim into a real caricature or a real monstrosity. Attention again should be paid to the almost benevolent <em>nuances</em> which, for instance, the Greek nobility imports into all the words by which it distinguishes the common people from itself; note how continuously a kind of pity, care, and consideration imparts its honeyed <em>flavour</em>, until at last almost all the words which are applied to the vulgar man survive finally as expressions for “unhappy,” “worthy of pity” (compare <i xml:lang="grc">δειλός</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">δείλαιος</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">πονηρός</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">μοχθηρός</i>; the latter two names really denoting the vulgar man as labour-slave and beast of burden)⁠—and how, conversely, “bad,” “low,” “unhappy” have never ceased to ring in the Greek ear with a tone in which “unhappy” is the predominant note: this is a heritage of the old noble aristocratic morality, which remains true to itself even in contempt (let philologists remember the sense in which <i xml:lang="grc">ὀιζυρός</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">ἄνολβος</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">τλήμων</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">δυστυχεῑν</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">ξυμφορά</i> used to be employed). The “wellborn” simply <em>felt</em> themselves the “happy”; they did not have to manufacture their happiness artificially through looking at their enemies, or in cases to talk and <em>lie themselves</em> into happiness (as is the custom with all resentful men); and similarly, complete men as they were, exuberant with strength, and consequently <em>necessarily</em> energetic, they were too wise to dissociate happiness from action⁠—activity becomes in their minds necessarily counted as happiness (that is the etymology of εὖ πρἆττειν)⁠—all in sharp contrast to the “happiness” of the weak and the oppressed, with their festering venom and malignity, among whom happiness appears essentially as a narcotic, a deadening, a quietude, a peace, a “Sabbath,” an enervation of the mind and relaxation of the limbs⁠—in short, a purely <em>passive</em> phenomenon. While the aristocratic man lived in confidence and openness with himself (γενναῐος, “noble-born,” emphasises the nuance “sincere,” and perhaps also “naive”), the resentful man, on the other hand, is neither sincere nor naive, nor honest and candid with himself. His soul <em>squints</em>; his mind loves hidden crannies, tortuous paths and back-doors, everything secret appeals to him as <em>his</em> world, <em>his</em> safety, <em>his</em> balm; he is past master in silence, in not forgetting, in waiting, in provisional self-depreciation and self-abasement. A race of such <em>resentful</em> men will of necessity eventually prove more <em>prudent</em> than any aristocratic race, it will honour prudence on quite a distinct scale, as, in fact, a paramount condition of existence, while prudence among aristocratic men is apt to be tinged with a delicate flavour of luxury and refinement; so among them it plays nothing like so integral a part as that complete certainty of function of the governing <em>unconscious</em> instincts, or as indeed a certain lack of prudence, such as a vehement and valiant charge, whether against danger or the enemy, or as those ecstatic bursts of rage, love, reverence, gratitude, by which at all times noble souls have recognised each other. When the resentment of the aristocratic man manifests itself, it fulfils and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction, and consequently instills no <em>venom</em>: on the other hand, it never manifests itself at all in countless instances, when in the case of the feeble and weak it would be inevitable. An inability to take seriously for any length of time their enemies, their disasters, their <em>misdeeds</em>⁠—that is the sign of the full strong natures who possess a superfluity of moulding plastic force, that heals completely and produces forgetfulness: a good example of this in the modern world is Mirabeau, who had no memory for any insults and meannesses which were practised on him, and who was only incapable of forgiving because he forgot. Such a man indeed shakes off with a shrug many a worm which would have buried itself in another; it is only in characters like these that we see the possibility (supposing, of course, that there is such a possibility in the world) of the real “<em>love</em> of one’s enemies.” What respect for his enemies is found, forsooth, in an aristocratic man⁠—and such a reverence is already a bridge to love! He insists on having his enemy to himself as his distinction. He tolerates no other enemy but a man in whose character there is nothing to despise and much to honour! On the other hand, imagine the “enemy” as the resentful man conceives him⁠—and it is here exactly that we see his work, his creativeness; he has conceived “the evil enemy,” the “evil one,” and indeed that is the root idea from which he now evolves as a contrasting and corresponding figure a “good one,” himself⁠—his very self!</p>

				<p>The method of this man is quite contrary to that of the aristocratic man, who conceives the root idea “good” spontaneously and straight away, that is to say, out of himself, and from that material then creates for himself a concept of “bad”! This “bad” of aristocratic origin and that “evil” out of the cauldron of unsatisfied hatred⁠—the former an imitation, an “extra,” an additional nuance; the latter, on the other hand, the original, the beginning, the essential act in the conception of a slave-morality⁠—these two words “bad” and “evil,” how great a difference do they mark, in spite of the fact that they have an identical contrary in the idea “good.” But the idea “good” is not the same: much rather let the question be asked, “Who is really evil according to the meaning of the morality of resentment?” In all sternness let it be answered thus:⁠—<em>just</em> the good man of the other morality, just the aristocrat, the powerful one, the one who rules, but who is distorted by the venomous eye of resentfulness, into a new colour, a new signification, a new appearance. This particular point we would be the last to deny: the man who learnt to know those “good” ones only as enemies, learnt at the same time not to know them only as “<em>evil enemies</em>” and the same men who <i xml:lang="la">inter pares</i> were kept so rigorously in bounds through convention, respect, custom, and gratitude, though much more through mutual vigilance and jealousy <i xml:lang="la">inter pares</i>, these men who in their relations with each other find so many new ways of manifesting consideration, self-control, delicacy, loyalty, pride, and friendship, these men are in reference to what is outside their circle (where the foreign element, a <em>foreign</em> country, begins), not much better than beasts of prey, which have been let loose. They enjoy there freedom from all social control, they feel that in the wilderness they can give vent with impunity to that tension which is produced by enclosure and imprisonment in the peace of society, they <em>revert</em> to the innocence of the beast-of-prey conscience, like jubilant monsters, who perhaps come from a ghastly bout of murder, arson, rape, and torture, with bravado and a moral equanimity, as though merely some wild student’s prank had been played, perfectly convinced that the poets have now an ample theme to sing and celebrate. It is impossible not to recognise at the core of all these aristocratic races the beast of prey; the magnificent <em>blonde brute</em>, avidly rampant for spoil and victory; this hidden core needed an outlet from time to time, the beast must get loose again, must return into the wilderness⁠—the Roman, Arabic, German, and Japanese nobility, the Homeric heroes, the Scandinavian Vikings, are all alike in this need. It is the aristocratic races who have left the idea “Barbarian” on all the tracks in which they have marched; nay, a consciousness of this very barbarianism, and even a pride in it, manifests itself even in their highest civilisation (for example, when Pericles says to his Athenians in that celebrated funeral oration, “Our audacity has forced a way over every land and sea, rearing everywhere imperishable memorials of itself for <em>good</em> and for <em>evil</em>.”). This audacity of aristocratic races, mad, absurd, and spasmodic as may be its expression; the incalculable and fantastic nature of their enterprises, Pericles sets in special relief and glory the ῥαθυμία of the Athenians, their nonchalance and contempt for safety, body, life, and comfort, their awful joy and intense delight in all destruction, in all the ecstasies of victory and cruelty⁠—all these features become crystallised, for those who suffered thereby in the picture of the “barbarian,” of the “evil enemy,” perhaps of the “Goth” and of the “Vandal.” The profound, icy mistrust which the German provokes, as soon as he arrives at power⁠—even at the present time⁠—is always still an aftermath of that inextinguishable horror with which for whole centuries Europe has regarded the wrath of the blonde Teuton beast (although between the old Germans and ourselves there exists scarcely a psychological, let alone a physical, relationship). I have once called attention to the embarrassment of Hesiod, when he conceived the series of social ages, and endeavoured to express them in gold, silver, and bronze. He could only dispose of the contradiction, with which he was confronted, by the Homeric world, an age magnificent indeed, but at the same time so awful and so violent, by making two ages out of one, which he henceforth placed one behind each other⁠—first, the age of the heroes and demigods, as that world had remained in the memories of the aristocratic families, who found therein their own ancestors; secondly, the bronze age, as that corresponding age appeared to the descendants of the oppressed, spoiled, ill-treated, exiled, enslaved; namely, as an age of bronze, as I have said, hard, cold, terrible, without feelings and without conscience, crushing everything, and bespattering everything with blood. Granted the truth of the theory now believed to be true, that the very <em>essence of all civilisation</em> is to <em>train</em> out of man, the beast of prey, a tame and civilised animal, a domesticated animal, it follows indubitably that we must regard as the real <em>tools of civilisation</em> all those instincts of reaction and resentment, by the help of which the aristocratic races, together with their ideals, were finally degraded and overpowered; though that has not yet come to be synonymous with saying that the bearers of those tools also <em>represented</em> the civilisation. It is rather the contrary that is not only probable⁠—nay, it is <em>palpable</em> today; these bearers of vindictive instincts that have to be bottled up, these descendants of all European and non-European slavery, especially of the pre-Aryan population⁠—these people, I say, represent the <em>decline</em> of humanity! These “tools of civilisation” are a disgrace to humanity, and constitute in reality more of an argument against civilisation, more of a reason why civilisation should be suspected. One may be perfectly justified in being always afraid of the blonde beast that lies at the core of all aristocratic races, and in being on one’s guard: but who would not a hundred times prefer to be afraid, when one at the same time admires, than to be immune from fear, at the cost of being perpetually obsessed with the loathsome spectacle of the distorted, the dwarfed, the stunted, the envenomed? And is that not our fate? What produces today our repulsion towards “man”?⁠—for we <em>suffer</em> from “man,” there is no doubt about it. It is not fear; it is rather that we have nothing more to fear from men; it is that the worm “man” is in the foreground and pullulates; it is that the “tame man,” the wretched mediocre and unedifying creature, has learnt to consider himself a goal and a pinnacle, an inner meaning, an historic principle, a “higher man”; yes, it is that he has a certain right so to consider himself, in so far as he feels that in contrast to that excess of deformity, disease, exhaustion, and effeteness whose odour is beginning to pollute present-day Europe, he at any rate has achieved a relative success, he at any rate still says “yes” to life.</p>

				<p>I cannot refrain at this juncture from uttering a sigh and one last hope. What is it precisely which I find intolerable? That which I alone cannot get rid of, which makes me choke and faint? Bad air! bad air! That something misbegotten comes near me; that I must inhale the odour of the entrails of a misbegotten soul!⁠—That excepted, what can one not endure in the way of need, privation, bad weather, sickness, toil, solitude? In point of fact, one manages to get over everything, born as one is to a burrowing and battling existence; one always returns once again to the light, one always lives again one’s golden hour of victory⁠—and then one stands as one was born, unbreakable, tense, ready for something more difficult, for something more distant, like a bow stretched but the tauter by every strain. But from time to time do ye grant me⁠—assuming that “beyond good and evil” there are goddesses who can grant⁠—one glimpse, grant me but one glimpse only, of something perfect, fully realised, happy, mighty, triumphant, of something that still gives cause for fear! A glimpse of a man that justifies the existence of man, a glimpse of an incarnate human happiness that realises and redeems, for the sake of which one may hold fast to <em>the belief in man</em>! For the position is this: in the dwarfing and levelling of the European man lurks <em>our</em> greatest peril, for it is this outlook which fatigues⁠—we see today nothing which wishes to be greater, we surmise that the process is always still backwards, still backwards towards something more attenuated, more inoffensive, more cunning, more comfortable, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more Christian⁠—man, there is no doubt about it, grows always “better”⁠—the destiny of Europe lies even in this⁠—that in losing the fear of man, we have also lost the hope in man, yea, the will to be man. The sight of man now fatigues.⁠—What is present-day Nihilism if it is not <em>that</em>?⁠—We are tired of <em>man</em>.</p>

				<p>But let us come back to it; the problem of <em>another</em> origin of the <em>good</em>⁠—of the good, as the resentful man has thought it out⁠—demands its solution. It is not surprising that the lambs should bear a grudge against the great birds of prey, but that is no reason for blaming the great birds of prey for taking the little lambs. And when the lambs say among themselves, “These birds of prey are evil, and he who is as far removed from being a bird of prey, who is rather its opposite, a lamb⁠—is he not good?” then there is nothing to cavil at in the setting up of this ideal, though it may also be that the birds of prey will regard it a little sneeringly, and perchance say to themselves, “<em>We</em> bear no grudge against them, these good lambs, we even like them: nothing is tastier than a tender lamb.” To require of strength that it should <em>not</em> express itself as strength, that it should not be a wish to overpower, a wish to overthrow, a wish to become master, a thirst for enemies and antagonisms and triumphs, is just as absurd as to require of weakness that it should express itself as strength. A quantum of force is just such a quantum of movement, will, action⁠—rather it is nothing else than just those very phenomena of moving, willing, acting, and can only appear otherwise in the misleading errors of language (and the fundamental fallacies of reason which have become petrified therein), which understands, and understands wrongly, all working as conditioned by a worker, by a “subject.” And just exactly as the people separate the lightning from its flash, and interpret the latter as a thing done, as the working of a subject which is called lightning, so also does the popular morality separate strength from the expression of strength, as though behind the strong man there existed some indifferent neutral substratum, which enjoyed a <em>caprice and option</em> as to whether or not it should express strength. But there is no such substratum, there is no “being” behind doing, working, becoming; “the doer” is a mere appanage to the action. The action is everything. In point of fact, the people duplicate the doing, when they make the lightning lighten, that is a “doing-doing”: they make the same phenomenon first a cause, and then, secondly, the effect of that cause. The scientists fail to improve matters when they say, “Force moves, force causes,” and so on. Our whole science is still, in spite of all its coldness, of all its freedom from passion, a dupe of the tricks of language, and has never succeeded in getting rid of that superstitious changeling “the subject” (the atom, to give another instance, is such a changeling, just as the Kantian “Thing-in-itself”). What wonder, if the suppressed and stealthily simmering passions of revenge and hatred exploit for their own advantage this belief, and indeed hold no belief with a more steadfast enthusiasm than this⁠—“that the strong has the <em>option</em> of being weak, and the bird of prey of being a lamb.” Thereby do they win for themselves the right of attributing to the birds of prey the <em>responsibility</em> for being birds of prey: when the oppressed, downtrodden, and overpowered say to themselves with the vindictive guile of weakness, “Let us be otherwise than the evil, namely, good! and good is everyone who does not oppress, who hurts no one, who does not attack, who does not pay back, who hands over revenge to God, who holds himself, as we do, in hiding; who goes out of the way of evil, and demands, in short, little from life; like ourselves the patient, the meek, the just,”⁠—yet all this, in its cold and unprejudiced interpretation, means nothing more than “once for all, the weak are weak; it is good to do <em>nothing for which we are not strong enough</em>”; but this dismal state of affairs, this prudence of the lowest order, which even insects possess (which in a great danger are fain to sham death so as to avoid doing “too much”), has, thanks to the counterfeiting and self-deception of weakness, come to masquerade in the pomp of an ascetic, mute, and expectant virtue, just as though the <em>very</em> weakness of the weak⁠—that is, forsooth, its <em>being</em>, its working, its whole unique inevitable inseparable reality⁠—were a voluntary result, something wished, chosen, a deed, an act of <em>merit</em>. This kind of man finds the belief in a neutral, free-choosing “subject” <em>necessary</em> from an instinct of self-preservation, of self-assertion, in which every lie is fain to sanctify itself. The subject (or, to use popular language, the <em>soul</em>) has perhaps proved itself the best dogma in the world simply because it rendered possible to the horde of mortal, weak, and oppressed individuals of every kind, that most sublime specimen of self-deception, the interpretation of weakness as freedom, of being this, or being that, as <em>merit</em>.</p>

				<p>Will anyone look a little into⁠—right into⁠—the mystery of how <em>ideals</em> are <em>manufactured</em> in this world? Who has the courage to do it? Come!</p>
				<p>Here we have a vista opened into these grimy workshops. Wait just a moment, dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Inquisitive and Foolhardy; your eye must first grow accustomed to this false changing light⁠—Yes! Enough! Now speak! What is happening below down yonder? Speak out that what you see, man of the most dangerous curiosity⁠—for now <em>I</em> am the listener.</p>
				<p>“I see nothing, I hear the more. It is a cautious, spiteful, gentle whispering and muttering together in all the corners and crannies. It seems to me that they are lying; a sugary softness adheres to every sound. Weakness is turned to <em>merit</em>, there is no doubt about it⁠—it is just as you say.”</p>
				<p>Further!</p>
				<p>“And the impotence which requites not, is turned to ‘goodness,’ craven baseness to meekness, submission to those whom one hates, to obedience (namely, obedience to one of whom they say that he ordered this submission⁠—they call him God). The inoffensive character of the weak, the very cowardice in which he is rich, his standing at the door, his forced necessity of waiting, gain here fine names, such as ‘patience,’ which is also called ‘virtue’; not being able to avenge oneself, is called not wishing to avenge oneself, perhaps even forgiveness (for <em>they</em> know not what they do⁠—we alone know what <em>they</em> do). They also talk of the ‘love of their enemies’ and sweat thereby.”</p>
				<p>Further!</p>
				<p>“They are miserable, there is no doubt about it, all these whisperers and counterfeiters in the corners, although they try to get warm by crouching close to each other, but they tell me that their misery is a favour and distinction given to them by God, just as one beats the dogs one likes best; that perhaps this misery is also a preparation, a probation, a training; that perhaps it is still more something which will one day be compensated and paid back with a tremendous interest in gold, nay in happiness. This they call ‘Blessedness.’ ”</p>
				<p>Further!</p>
				<p>“They are now giving me to understand, that not only are they better men than the mighty, the lords of the earth, whose spittle they have got to lick (<em>not</em> out of fear, not at all out of fear! But because God ordains that one should honour all authority)⁠—not only are they better men, but that they also have a ‘better time,’ at any rate, will one day have a ‘better time.’ But enough! Enough! I can endure it no longer. Bad air! Bad air! These workshops <em>where ideals are manufactured</em>⁠—verily they reek with the crassest lies.”</p>
				<p>Nay. Just one minute! You are saying nothing about the masterpieces of these virtuosos of black magic, who can produce whiteness, milk, and innocence out of any black you like: have you not noticed what a pitch of refinement is attained by their <i xml:lang="fr">chef d’oeuvre</i>, their most audacious, subtle, ingenious, and lying artist-trick? Take care! These cellar-beasts, full of revenge and hate⁠—what do they make, forsooth, out of their revenge and hate? Do you hear these words? Would you suspect, if you trusted only their words, that you are among men of resentment and nothing else?</p>
				<p>“I understand, I prick my ears up again (ah! ah! ah! and I hold my nose). Now do I hear for the first time that which they have said so often: ‘We good, <em>we are the righteous</em>’⁠—what they demand they call not revenge but ‘the triumph of <em>righteousness</em>’; what they hate is not their enemy, no, they hate ‘unrighteousness,’ ‘godlessness’; what they believe in and hope is not the hope of revenge, the intoxication of sweet revenge (⁠—“sweeter than honey,” did Homer call it?), but the victory of God, of the <em>righteous God</em> over the ‘godless’; what is left for them to love in this world is not their brothers in hate, but their ‘brothers in love,’ as they say, all the good and righteous on the earth.”</p>
				<p>And how do they name that which serves them as a solace against all the troubles of life⁠—their phantasmagoria of their anticipated future blessedness?</p>
				<p>“How? Do I hear right? They call it ‘the last judgment,’ the advent of <em>their</em> kingdom, ‘the kingdom of God’⁠—but <em>in the meanwhile</em> they live ‘in faith,’ ‘in love,’ ‘in hope.’ ”</p>
				<p>Enough! Enough!</p>
			</section>
			<section id="chapter-1-15">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">15</h3>
				<p>In the faith in what? In the love for what? In the hope of what? These weaklings!⁠—they also, forsooth, wish to be the strong some time; there is no doubt about it, some time <em>their</em> kingdom also must come⁠—“the kingdom of God” is their name for it, as has been mentioned: they are so meek in everything! Yet in order to experience <em>that</em> kingdom it is necessary to live long, to live beyond death⁠—yes, <em>eternal</em> life is necessary so that one can make up forever for that earthly life “in faith,” “in love,” “in hope.” Make up for what? Make up by what? Dante, as it seems to me, made a crass mistake when with awe-inspiring ingenuity he placed that inscription over the gate of his hell, “Me too made eternal love”: at any rate the following inscription would have a much better right to stand over the gate of the Christian Paradise and its “eternal blessedness”⁠—“Me too made eternal hate”⁠—granted of course that a truth may rightly stand over the gate to a lie! For what is the blessedness of that Paradise? Possibly we could quickly surmise it; but it is better that it should be explicitly attested by an authority who in such matters is not to be disparaged, Thomas of Aquinas, the great teacher and saint. “<i xml:lang="la">Beati in regno celesti</i>” says he, as gently as a lamb, “<i xml:lang="la">videbunt poenas damnatorum, ut beatitudo illis magis complaceat</i>.” Or if we wish to hear a stronger tone, a word from the mouth of a triumphant father of the Church, who warned his disciples against the cruel ecstasies of the public spectacles⁠—But why? Faith offers us much more⁠—says he, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">de <abbr>Spectac.</abbr></i>, <abbr>c.</abbr> 29 <abbr>ss.</abbr>⁠—something much stronger; thanks to the redemption, joys of quite another kind stand at our disposal; instead of athletes we have our martyrs; we wish for blood, well, we have the blood of Christ⁠—but what then awaits us on the day of his return, of his triumph. And then does he proceed, does this enraptured visionary: “<i xml:lang="la">at enim supersunt alia spectacula, ille ultimas et perpetuus judicii dies, ille nationibus insperatus, ille derisus, cum tanta saeculi vetustas et tot ejus nativitates uno igne haurientur.

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">16</h3>
				<p>Let us come to a conclusion. The two <em>opposing values</em>, “good and bad,” “good and evil,” have fought a dreadful, thousand-year fight in the world, and though indubitably the second value has been for a long time in the preponderance, there are not wanting places where the fortune of the fight is still undecisive. It can almost be said that in the meanwhile the fight reaches a higher and higher level, and that in the meanwhile it has become more and more intense, and always more and more psychological; so that nowadays there is perhaps no more decisive mark of the <em>higher nature</em>, of the more psychological nature, than to be in that sense self-contradictory, and to be actually still a battleground for those two opposites. The symbol of this fight, written in a writing which has remained worthy of perusal throughout the course of history up to the present time, is called “Rome against Judaea, Judaea against Rome.” Hitherto there has been no greater event than <em>that</em> fight, the putting of <em>that</em> question, <em>that</em> deadly antagonism. Rome found in the Jew the incarnation of the unnatural, as though it were its diametrically opposed monstrosity, and in Rome the Jew was held to be <em>convicted of hatred</em> of the whole human race: and rightly so, in so far as it is right to link the well-being and the future of the human race to the unconditional mastery of the aristocratic values, of the Roman values. What, conversely, did the Jews feel against Rome? One can surmise it from a thousand symptoms, but it is sufficient to carry one’s mind back to the Johannian Apocalypse, that most obscene of all the written outbursts, which has revenge on its conscience. (One should also appraise at its full value the profound logic of the Christian instinct, when over this very book of hate it wrote the name of the Disciple of Love, that selfsame disciple to whom it attributed that impassioned and ecstatic Gospel⁠—therein lurks a portion of truth, however much literary forging may have been necessary for this purpose.) The Romans were the strong and aristocratic; a nation stronger and more aristocratic has never existed in the world, has never even been dreamed of; every relic of them, every inscription enraptures, granted that one can divine <em>what</em> it is that writes the inscription. The Jews, conversely, were that priestly nation of resentment <i xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, possessed by a unique genius for popular morals: just compare with the Jews the nations with analogous gifts, such as the Chinese or the Germans, so as to realise afterwards what is first rate, and what is fifth rate.</p>
				<p>Which of them has been provisionally victorious, Rome or Judaea? but there is not a shadow of doubt; just consider to whom in Rome itself nowadays you bow down, as though before the quintessence of all the highest values⁠—and not only in Rome, but almost over half the world, everywhere where man has been tamed or is about to be tamed⁠—to <em>three Jews</em>, as we know, and <em>one Jewess</em> (to Jesus of Nazareth, to Peter the fisher, to Paul the tentmaker, and to the mother of the aforesaid Jesus, named Mary). This is very remarkable: Rome is undoubtedly defeated. At any rate there took place in the Renaissance a brilliantly sinister revival of the classical ideal, of the aristocratic valuation of all things: Rome herself, like a man waking up from a trance, stirred beneath the burden of the new Judaised Rome that had been built over her, which presented the appearance of an ecumenical synagogue and was called the “Church”: but immediately Judaea triumphed again, thanks to that fundamentally popular (German and English) movement of revenge, which is called the Reformation, and taking also into account its inevitable corollary, the restoration of the Church⁠—the restoration also of the ancient graveyard peace of classical Rome. Judaea proved yet once more victorious over the classical ideal in the French Revolution, and in a sense which was even more crucial and even more profound: the last political aristocracy that existed in Europe, that of the <em>French</em> seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, broke into pieces beneath the instincts of a resentful populace⁠—never had the world heard a greater jubilation, a more uproarious enthusiasm: indeed, there took place in the midst of it the most monstrous and unexpected phenomenon; the ancient ideal <em>itself</em> swept before the eyes and conscience of humanity with all its life and with unheard-of splendour, and in opposition to resentment’s lying war-cry of <em>the prerogative of the most</em>, in opposition to the will to lowliness, abasement, and equalisation, the will to a retrogression and twilight of humanity, there rang out once again, stronger, simpler, more penetrating than ever, the terrible and enchanting counter-war-cry of <em>the prerogative of the few</em>! Like a final signpost to other ways, there appeared Napoleon, the most unique and violent anachronism that ever existed, and in him the incarnate problem <em>of the aristocratic ideal in itself</em>⁠—consider well what a problem it is:⁠—Napoleon, that synthesis of Monster and Superman.</p>

				<p>Was it therewith over? Was that greatest of all antitheses of ideals thereby relegated <i xml:lang="la">ad acta</i> for all time? Or only postponed, postponed for a long time? May there not take place at some time or other a much more awful, much more carefully prepared flaring up of the old conflagration? Further! Should not one wish <em>that</em> consummation with all one’s strength?⁠—will it oneself? demand it oneself? He who at this juncture begins, like my readers, to reflect, to think further, will have difficulty in coming quickly to a conclusion⁠—ground enough for me to come myself to a conclusion, taking it for granted that for some time past what I mean has been sufficiently clear, what I exactly <em>mean</em> by that dangerous motto which is inscribed on the body of my last book: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Beyond Good and Evil</i>⁠—at any rate that is not the same as “Beyond Good and Bad.”</p>
				<p>Note.⁠—I avail myself of the opportunity offered by this treatise to express, openly and formally, a wish which up to the present has only been expressed in occasional conversations with scholars, namely, that some Faculty of philosophy should, by means of a series of prize essays, gain the glory of having promoted the further study of the <em>history of morals</em>⁠—perhaps this book may serve to give forcible impetus in such a direction. With regard to a possibility of this character, the following question deserves consideration. It merits quite as much the attention of philologists and historians as of actual professional philosophers.</p>
				<p>“<em>What indication of the history of the evolution of the moral ideas is afforded by philology, and especially by etymological investigation?</em>”</p>
				<p>On the other hand, it is of course equally necessary to induce physiologists and doctors to be interested in these problems (<em>of the value</em> of the <em>valuations</em> which have prevailed up to the present): in this connection the professional philosophers may be trusted to act as the spokesmen and intermediaries in these particular instances, after, of course, they have quite succeeded in transforming the relationship between philosophy and physiology and medicine, which is originally one of coldness and suspicion, into the most friendly and fruitful reciprocity. In point of fact, all tables of values, all the “thou shalts” known to history and ethnology, need primarily a <em>physiological</em>, at any rate in preference to a psychological, elucidation and interpretation; all equally require a critique from medical science. The question, “What is the <em>value</em> of this or that table of ‘values’ and morality?” will be asked from the most varied standpoints. For instance, the question of “valuable <em>for what</em>” can never be analysed with sufficient nicety. That, for instance, which would evidently have value with regard to promoting in a race the greatest possible powers of endurance (or with regard to increasing its adaptability to a specific climate, or with regard to the preservation of the greatest number) would have nothing like the same value, if it were a question of evolving a stronger species. In gauging values, the good of the majority and the good of the minority are opposed standpoints: we leave it to the naivete of English biologists to regard the former standpoint as <em>intrinsically</em> superior. <em>All</em> the sciences have now to pave the way for the future task of the philosopher; this task being understood to mean, that he must solve the problem of <em>value</em>, that he has to fix the <em>hierarchy of values</em>.</p>
